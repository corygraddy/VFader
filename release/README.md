# VFader

**Build 48** - 32 Virtual Faders with MIDI CC for Disting NT

## Overview

VFader is a Disting NT algorithm that provides 32 virtual faders organized into 4 pages of 8 faders each. Each fader can be controlled via the three pots (L, C, R) and outputs MIDI CC messages (7-bit or 14-bit).

## Key Features

- **32 Virtual Faders**: 4 pages × 8 faders per page
- **Dual Control Modes**: 
  - **Note Mode**: Send specific MIDI notes with customizable scales
  - **Number Mode**: Send scaled values (0-100 range, customizable)
- **MIDI Output**: 
  - 7-bit CC (CC 1-32, values 0-127)
  - 14-bit CC (CC 0-31 MSB paired with CC 32-63 LSB, values 0-16383)
- **Pickup Modes**: 
  - **Scaled**: Physical pot position scales the fader's range
  - **Catch**: Fader doesn't change until pot catches the current value
- **Custom Naming**: Each fader has a 6-character name + 5-character category

### Basic Operation

#### Page Navigation
- **Left Encoder**: Rotate to select pages 1-4
- **Display**: Top-right corner shows current page number

#### Fader Selection
- **Right Encoder**: Rotate to select faders 1-8 within the current page
- **Display**: Selected fader is highlighted

#### Controlling Faders
- **Left Pot**: Controls the fader to the LEFT of selection (or first fader if leftmost selected)
- **Center Pot**: Controls the SELECTED fader
- **Right Pot**: Controls the fader to the RIGHT of selection (or last fader if rightmost selected)

## Fader Configuration

### Naming Faders

1. Select the fader you want to name
2. Press **Right Encoder Button** to enter name edit mode
3. **Left Encoder**: Navigate between characters (6 name + 5 category chars)
4. **Right Encoder**: Change the current character
5. Press **Left Encoder Button** to exit and remember to save the preset!

**Name Structure:**
- Characters 1-6: Fader name (displayed on main screen)
- Characters 7-11: Category (displayed in bottom-right corner when fader is selected)

### Fader Function Settings

From name edit mode, turn **Right Pot** to access function settings:

#### Display Mode
- **Number**: Displays values 0-100 (scaled to MIDI range)
- **Note**: Displays specific MIDI note numbers

#### Accidental (Note Mode only)
- **Sharp**: Display notes with sharps (C, C#, D, etc.)
- **Flat**: Display notes with flats (C, Db, D, etc.)

#### Top Value / Bottom Value
Defines the range for the fader:
- **Note Mode**: Set the top and bottom MIDI notes (0-127, displayed as note names)
- **Number Mode**: Set the top and bottom values (0-100)

The fader will snap to values within this range. Top must be greater than bottom.

#### Note Mask (Note Mode only)
Select which notes in the chromatic scale are active:
- Active notes shown in color 15
- Inactive notes shown in color 7
- Only active notes will be sent when moving the fader
- Useful for constraining to specific scales (pentatonic, major, minor, etc.)

### Macro Fader Settings

From name edit mode, turn **Right Pot** to page 3 to access macro fader settings. A macro fader controls multiple child faders to the right of it.

#### Control Count (0-31)
- **Off (0)**: Fader operates independently
- **1-31**: Number of faders to the right that this fader will control
- Maximum count is limited by faders remaining (can't control beyond fader 32)
- Cannot overlap with another macro fader

#### Control Mode
- **Absolute**: Children move in parallel with the macro fader
  - When macro moves up/down, all children move by the same amount
  - Maintains relative spacing between children
  - Best for groups that should move together (e.g., mix bus faders)

- **Relative**: Children scale proportionally based on macro position
  - Macro at 50% (center): children stay at their current positions
  - Macro below 50%: children scale toward 0.0 proportionally
  - Macro above 50%: children scale toward 1.0 proportionally
  - Manual child adjustments are preserved - reference values update continuously
  - Best for dynamic control (e.g., overall volume while preserving mix balance)

**Visual Indicators:**
- Macro faders show "M" on the right side
- Child faders show "C" on the right side

**Note:** When you manually adjust a child fader, its reference value updates. In Relative mode, this new position becomes the scaling reference for future macro movements.

## Parameters

### FADER 1-8
The 8 physical control parameters that map to the current page's virtual faders. These are what external controllers (like F8R) can map to.

### PAGE
Selects which page (1-4) is currently active. Hidden from parameter page but accessible via left encoder in the UI.

### MIDI Mode
- **7-bit CC**: Sends CC 1-32 with values 0-127
- **14-bit CC**: Sends CC 0-31 (MSB) paired with CC 32-63 (LSB), values 0-16383
- Default: 14-bit CC

### Pickup Mode
Controls how physical pot movement affects the virtual fader:
- **Scaled**: Pot position (0-100%) scales the fader's configured range
- **Catch**: Fader value doesn't change until pot "catches up" to it
  - Prevents value jumps when switching pages
  - Pot must cross the current fader value before changes take effect
- Default: Catch

### Pot Control
Enable or disable fader level changes via the three pots:
- **On**: Pots control fader levels (default)
  - Left pot controls the fader to the left of selected
  - Center pot controls the selected fader
  - Right pot controls the fader to the right of selected
  - Dotted lines appear under adjacent faders to show pot mapping
- **Off**: Pots do not change fader levels
  - Only the solid line appears under the selected fader
  - All three pots are disabled in this mode
  - Useful when you want to prevent accidental pot changes
- Default: On

## MIDI Output Details

### 7-bit Mode
- Faders 1-32 → MIDI CC 1-32
- Values: 0-127
- Standard single-byte MIDI CC messages

### 14-bit Mode
- Faders 1-32 → MIDI CC 0-31 (MSB) paired with CC 32-63 (LSB)
- Values: 0-16383 (high resolution)
- Follows standard MIDI 14-bit CC implementation
- Alternates sending MSB and LSB each step for efficiency

### MIDI Routing
- **USB MIDI**: Sent to USB host
- **Internal**: Available to other Disting NT algorithms via MIDI routing

**Note:** MIDI channel is currently hardcoded to channel 1.

## Use Cases

### Controlling a DAW
- Map VFader's MIDI CCs to DAW mixer faders, plugin parameters, or automation
- Use 14-bit mode for smooth, high-resolution control
- Create presets for different mixing sessions

### Modular Control via MIDI
- Control other Disting NT algorithms via internal MIDI routing
- Use Note mode to sequence melodic content
- Use Number mode for parameter control
- Route MIDI to external MIDI→CV converters for modular control

### External MIDI Gear
- Control hardware synths, effects, or lighting
- Use Note mode to play specific notes from a scale
- Save presets for different performance setups

### F8R Integration
- Map F8R's faders to VFader's FADER 1-8 parameters
- Control 8 faders simultaneously per page
- Switch pages for 32 total faders under F8R control
- Use MIDI output to control external gear or DAW

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Efficient Editing**: Use the 3-pot layout (Left/Center/Right) to adjust adjacent faders quickly without moving selection.

2. **Scale Constraints**: In Note mode, disable notes in the chromatic scale to constrain to specific musical scales.

3. **Value Ranges**: Set custom ranges (e.g., 20-80) to limit fader travel for fine control over a smaller parameter range.

4. **Pickup Mode**: Use Catch mode when switching between pages to avoid sudden value jumps.

5. **Categories**: Use the 5-char category field to organize faders (e.g., "MIX", "FILT", "ENV", "FX").

6. **14-bit Smoothness**: Enable 14-bit mode for ultra-smooth parameter changes, especially important for audio-rate parameters.

## Troubleshooting

### Fader not responding to pot
- Check that the correct page is selected
- Verify Pickup Mode settings (may need to "catch" the value in Catch mode)
- Ensure the pot is mapped to the correct FADER parameter
- Check that Pot Control is set to "On" (not "Off")

### MIDI not received by destination
- Verify MIDI routing in Disting NT settings
- Check that the receiving device is listening on channel 1
- Confirm USB MIDI connection (if using USB)

### Values jumping when switching pages
- Enable **Catch** pickup mode to prevent jumps
- Alternatively, use **Scaled** mode and adjust pots after page switch
